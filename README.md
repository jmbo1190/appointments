# Appointments
This is an example React app build with TDD (Test-Driven-Development) methodology, according to 
[Mastering React Test-Driven Development - Second Edition](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web-development/9781803247120/25), by Daniel Irvine.

## To run all the tests
Enter the following command in a terminal:
```
npm test
```

## To run a single test module
Enter the same command in a terminal, with the path to the test module specified as additional argument:
```
npm test test/AppointmentsDayView.test.js
```

## To build the app
Enter the following command in a terminal:
```
npm run build
```

Then you can open the app by browsing to [dist/index.html](./dist/index.html).
